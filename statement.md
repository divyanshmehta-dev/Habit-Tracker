# Habit Tracker – IPP Project

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to build consistent daily habits such as studying, exercising, or reading. There is a need for a simple tool that helps them record their daily habit completion and review their overall progress over time.

## Scope of the Project
This project focuses on a basic command-line habit tracker. It allows users to:
- Define their own habits
- Mark habits as completed for the current day
- View simple statistics of how many times each habit was completed

The scope is limited to a single user and local CSV file storage. No networking, authentication, or GUI is included.

## Target Users
- Students who want to track academic and personal habits
- Individuals looking for a simple, lightweight habit logging tool

## High-Level Features
- Add a new habit with a name and category
- List all existing habits
- Mark a habit as completed for the current day
- View completion statistics for each habit (number of times completed)
- Store data in CSV files (`data/habits.csv` and `data/completions.csv`)
